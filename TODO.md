# TODO

Here is list of major work needed for 1.0 version of library.
Ordering of implementation is not static.

- [ ] All JVM native platforms support
- [ ] Android support
- [ ] Multi-platform support (iOS and JS)
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Tests
- [ ] Benchmarks (memory and speed)
- [ ] Publish to maven central and jcenter
- [ ] Automated gradle cmake build for all platforms
- [ ] Version compatibility checker
- [ ] Possible separation of library version and tdlib version.
F.e. publishing 1.1.0 version of library with 1.5.0 and 1.6.0 versions of tdlib.
